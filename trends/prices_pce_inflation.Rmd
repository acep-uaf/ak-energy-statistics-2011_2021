# Watch out, columns are not uniform across years. This is going to be a headache later!
# It looks like columns are somewhat contiguous, can be grouped as follows:
2011
  different from 2012 and 2013 in first column name at least ("UtilityName" vs "Utility.Name").
  also has 4 more columns
  
2012, 2013
  21 columns, not sure what's going on here. Missing all cross-reference data (maybe join from later years?)
  
2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
  28 columns (2018 is an outlier with 27 columns)
  
2019, 2020, 2021
  28 columns, possibly different names than above


### Build a library
```{R}
options(scipen=999)

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)


library(readxl)

```


### Set working directory
```{R}
