"(1) The column labeled Fossil Fuel Turbines include, gas and steam turbines as well as combined cycle systems. For detail information regarding prime mover and fuel type used at each plant, please refer to Table 2.4a.
Fossil Fuel Turbines:
     Gas Turbine (combustion-turbine) produces electricity by passing hot gases produced from combustion of natural gas or distillate oil through the turbine.
     Steam turbine (fossil-fueled) the fuel is burned in a boiler to produce steam; the steam turns the turbine to produce electricity. 
     Combined Cycle generators produce electricity from otherwise lost waste heat exiting from one or more gas (combustion) turbines. The exiting heat is routed to a conventional boiler or to a heat recovery steam generator for utilization by a steam turbine in the production of electricity. This process increases the efficiency of the electric generating unit. 
Internal Combustion Reciprocating Engine (diesel) generators have cylinders in which the combustion of fuel takes place and the engine provides mechanical energy to drive the generator to produce electricity. 
Hydroelectric power is produced from flowing water that spins a turbine connected to a electricity generator. 
Wind turbine produces electricity by converting kinetic energy into mechanical energy to drive electric power generators.
