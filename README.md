# Alaska Energy Statistics, 2011 - 2021

**WARNING**
> This data contains inconsistencies. Please pay special attention to the [errata](errata.md). This repository is designed to act as an archive for the workbooks as delivered via contract.

**NOTE**
> This data has been reproduced in an updated form for the [2024 Alaska Electricity Trends Report](https://acep-uaf.github.io/aetr-web-book-2024/). This report includes updated data for download that addresses many of the issues in the [errata](errata.md).

## Overview

This repository is the landing page for [ACEP](https://uaf.edu/acep)'s support of the Alaska Energy Statistics workbooks and reports. 

The **Alaska Energy Statistics** is a long-running collection of data and reports about  energy production, consumption, and related topics specific to the state of Alaska.  The workbooks are developed to provide community & utility level datasets that support regional and statewide aggregations for use in the report.

This is part of a 40+ year effort to create and maintain high level views of the state's energy profile that are useful for policy makers, buinesess, researches, and others interested in Alaska's energy sector.  

- [Alaska Energy Authority](https://www.akenergyauthority.org/), is the state's energy office and lead agency for statewide energy policy and program development.
- [Alaska Center for Energy and Power](https://uaf.edu/acep), a research center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF)
- [Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER)](https://iseralaska.org/) is a research center at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA).

Team supporting development of the 2011-2021 workbooks:
- Neil McMahon (DOWL Inc) - Created/updated 2011-2021 workbooks
- Steve Colt (UAF ACEP) - Collaborated on validation and fixing of workbooks. Wrote data
  disctionary. 
- Gwen Holdmann (UAF ACEP) - Collaborated on review and feedback of workbooks.
- Ian MacDougall (UAF ACEP)  - Led collection of workbooks into a repository and supported
  review and analysis. 
- Vanessa Raymond (UAF ACEP) - Supported workbook archiving and distribution.
