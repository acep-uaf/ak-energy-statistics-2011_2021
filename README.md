The **Alaska Energy Statistics** is a long-running collection of data and reports about  energy production, consumption, and related topics specific to the state of Alaska.  The workbooks are developed to provide community & utility level datasets that support regional and statewide aggregations for use in the report.

This is part of a 40+ year effort to create and maintain high level views of the state's energy profile that are useful for policy makers, buinesess, researches, and others interested in Alaska's energy sector.
