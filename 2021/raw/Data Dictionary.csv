Table 2.2a shows sources and uses of electric energy,Table 2.2a is modeled on the EIA Form 861 tabulation of sources and uses of electric energy. Form 861 requires the balancing of total sources with total disposition of energy. PCE reporting channels do not require this balancing.

"Generation (PCE=gross, EIA=net)",Generation is net of station service for EIA data and gross of (includes) station service for PCE data
Purchased Power,Purchased power in MWh
Net Wheeled Power,Data shown only for entities reporting on EIA Form 861. The difference between power received and power delivered across the entity's transmission system. This is accounted for as one source of energy to the entity; it is also included as part of total losses (which is a component of disposition).
Total Disposition (= Total Sources),"Total Disposition equals Generation + Purchased Power + Net Wheeled Power. In this table Net Wheeled Power adds in the EIA reporting category ""Transmission by Other Losses"", which EIA defines as ""the amount of energy losses associated with the wheeling of electricity provided to your system by other utilities."" The inclusion of ""Tranmission by Other Losses"" applies to only one utility, the Alaska Electric & Energy Coop, a subsidiary of Homer Electric Association which generates power and sells it for resale to Homer Electric Association. For AEEC, ""Tranmission by Other Losses"" exactly offsets Net Wheeled Power."
Sales to Consumers,The amount of electricity sold to customers purchasing electricity for their own use and not for resale
Sales for Resale,"The amount of electricity sold for resale purposes. According to EIA Instructions for Form 861, ""This entry should include sales for resale to power marketers (reported separately in previous years), full and partial requirements customers, firm power customers, and non-firm customers."""
Furnished without Payment,"According to EIA Instructions for Form 861, ""The amount of electricity furnished by the electric utility without charge, such as to a municipality under a franchise agreement or for public street and highway lighting."" For entities reporting to the PCE program, the data represent the reporting category ""Unbilled kWh Sold."""
Used by facility,"For entities reporting to the PCE program, these data represent ""Powerhouse Consumption."" For entities reporting on EIA Form 861,  ""The amount of electricity used by the electric utility in its electric and other departments without charge."" Because generation reported to EIA is net of station service, Used by Facility does NOT include station service."
Unaccountable / Energy Loss,"Unnaccountable / Energy Loss is the difference (residual) between Total Disposition and the sum of: Sales to Consumers + Sales for Resale + Furnished without Payment + Used by Facility. For EIA data, this amount is a data point on the Form 861 dataset. For PCE reporting entities, this amount is calculated as the difference between Total Disposition (= Total Sources) and Sales to Consumers + Sales for Resale + Furnished without Payment + Used by facility. For PCE communities that receive (or provide) power over an intertie as part of a single utility, Unaccountable / Energy Loss includes these amounts, because there is no breakout of data showing these transfers as a source (or a use) of energy. For example, when Community A has zero generation, receives 100 MWh over an intertie, and sells 90 MWh, the calculation of Unaccountable / Energy Loss will come out as -90. (minus 90). Similarly, when Community B generates 200 MWh, transfers 100 over to Community A, and sells 90, the calculation of Unaccountable / Energy Loss will come out as 200-90 = 110."

For this method, we used the average annual heat rate in Btu/kWh of the nation’s fossil fuel-fired power plants (natural gas, coal, petroleum). The resulting Btu value is the equivalent amount of fossil fuels that would need to be consumed to produce the same amount of electricity from these noncombustible energy sources.""
