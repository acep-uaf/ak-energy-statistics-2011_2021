"All averages are weighted. Percentages of residential consumption may seem lower than expected because some communities eligible to receive PCE participated in the program for only a portion of the year. If during a given month a utility did not participate and did not receive a PCE payment, then its eligible PCE consumption is 0% of sales for that month.",NA,NA,NA,NA
